# Tutorial: Designing and Developing a Dapp on NEO
A detailed walkthrough on creating a real world decentralized application.

This tutorial will walk you through building a decentralized app on the NEO blockchain. The tutorial will use C# as example, but once you've grasps the core concept, this project can be written in any other language you prefer. The example project we are using is a book store that lets authors add books on the store which can be sold directly to customers. 

The reason why I used this as an example is because it includes the basic building blocks of any data oriented software: retrieving, creating, updating and deleting data. Albeit, this guide will be a long read, but you will definately learn a lot more by building a real world app as compared to a hello world example. So grab a drink, put on some music if you'd like, and let's get started.
